My goal for this project was to build a prototype tensorflow.js web app and deploy it online. The app automatically detects and segments intracranial hemorrhages in brain CT scans. It takes as input a single jpg or png image (brain window) and outputs a segmentation showing the area where bleeding has been detected.

The process used to build and train the model is described in this Kaggle kernel:<br>

The dataset used to train the model can be found on Kaggle:<br>

All javascript, html and css files used to create the web app are available in this repo.
